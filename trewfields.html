        <H6>THE TASK</H6>
        <p>Trew Fields is the UK’s first cancer awareness and holistic health festival, and it is now evolving into a media brand. They aim to provide cancer awareness and holistic health content and need a website that reflects that. They approached us to create a responsive website that will increase festival ticket sales and allow Trew Fields to grow into a health education brand.</p>

        <p>The brief was to:</p>
      
        <p>1. Create a more professional and user friendly website layout</p>
      
        <p>2. Improve the look and feel to create a more festival visual style</p>
      
        <p>3. Increasing engagement</p>
      
        <p>4. Improving the visual appeal of the app</p>

      <div class="research">
        <H6>RESEARCH</H6>
        <p>In order to achieve the goals set out, we started with research to understand the user needs and wants, and how the current website meets these.</p>

        <p>The aim of the research was to:</p>
        <p>- understand what users need from a cancer awareness and holistic health website</p>
        <p>- test how well the current website functions as a festival website</p>
        <p>- discover how other websites are meeting users' needs</p>
        <p>We did this by creating an online survey to reach a wide audience, to give us insight into what users find valuable from online health sources.</p>
        <img id="trewfieldsresearch" src="./Resources/Trew Fields/trew fields findings.png">

        <p>We also conducted a competitor analysis. We compared Trew Fields to other health content and festival websites. The green ticks show what Trew Fields have currently, the orange dots are some recommendations for what Trew Fields can include.</p>
      
        <img id="trewfieldsresearch" src="./Resources/Trew Fields/trew fields competitor analysis.png">
        <p>From the competitor analysis we found that the Trew Fields website does offer more information than their competitors. However, from conducting user tests on the Trew Fields website we found that the website was far too text heavy, and users really struggled to understand what Trew Fields was and what the festival entailed. Users also found the checkout process to be so long that it was almost impossible to buy a ticket.</p>

      <div class="planning">
        <H6>PLANNING</H6>
        <p>Based on our research, we created two user personas to better understand our users. We focussed on the user Caroline, who is a teacher recently diagnosed with cancer. We used this persona to create a storyboard which helped us understand the user more and how we can create a site that meets their needs.</p>
      
        <img id="trewfieldsresearch" src="./Resources/Trew Fields/STORYBOARD.png">

        <p>We then created a site map, which gave us a structure to our designs. We needed to ensure the site map made it easier for users to understand what Trew Fields was and what the festival offered. We also needed to plan out the content area of the site which did not exist before.</p>

      <div class="design">
        <H6>DESIGN</H6>
        <p>The design process started with good old pen and paper! With the structure of our site mapped out, we conducted brainstorming sessions to rapidly create as many visual interpretations of the site as possible.</p>
        <p>We then turned these into digital mockups, which we tested, tested and tested again to give us insights into how we can create a more user friendly design. We made many iterations, some of which are shown below.</p>
        <p>​As we were also revamping the UI of the website, we used this time to create a colour palette and the visual elements, which we then applied to our mid-fidelity screens and tested again!</p>
        <p>Below you can see an example of the evolution of our designs, from our first prototype to the finished high fidelity screens.</p>

        <H6>REFLECTIONS</H6>
        <p class="bold">The challenge</p>
        <p>Probably my biggest challenge with this project was working out how to approach such a sensitive topic. We needed to conduct research with people that have been affected by cancer, either directly or through a loved one, to gain insight into how online resources can help them. We decided online surveys were the best way to approach this as it put less pressure on respondents who may find the questions difficult.</p>
        <p>Time was also a big challenge for this project - we were only two designers responsible for redesigning the festival area of the website, building out a new content side of the site and redesigning the UI elements in 3 weeks. It was tough but we worked well together to get the job done.</p>
        <p class="bold">Lessons learnt</p>
        <p>This project was a really good lesson in empathy and approaching sensitive subjects. While we wanted to ensure that the website was as positive as Trew Fields festival is without being insensitive. We also needed to ensure the content area of the site looked credible and trustworthy, while also being fun and light.</p>
