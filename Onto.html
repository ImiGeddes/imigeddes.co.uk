        <H6>THE PROJECT</H6>
        <p>Onto is Europe’s largest electric vehicle (EV) subscription service. It’s an all inclusive subscription service, meaning it offers everything from charging, servicing and breakdown cover with your car.</P> 

        <p>The app is one of Onto’s core digital products and main customer touch points. It enables Onto’s customers to manage their subscription and enhances their EV experience.</p>

        <p>While I was working at Onto we grew to a team of 8 designers, from Content Design, Service Design and Product Design. I worked as the sole Product Designer in the app team, a cross-functional team of engineers and a Product Manager.</p>

        <h6>APP REDESIGN</h6>
        <p>A large part of my role at Onto has been getting the app redesign over the line. Onto went through a rebranding process, and we took this opportunity to redesign the app, improve the navigation and bring everything in line with the new design system. I joined Onto during the redesign process and handed over the redesign project. I worked closely with the engineers and Product Manager in my team to ensure the project was completed.</p>

        <h6>NEW FUNCTIONALITY - DAMAGE REPORTING</h6>
        <H4>The Problem</H4>
        <P>The app acts as a companion for customer’s subscriptions, and is designed to make having an electric car easier and simpler. Reporting damage was a common user need, which traditionally had to be done by contacting customer service. This process took a long time, with back and forth asking for pictures and additional details, taking up Customer Service time and creating a bad experience for the customer.</P>
        <h4>The Solution</h4>
        <p>We added a damage reporting flow to the app, so users can quickly and easily report their damage without having to contact Customer Service. The solution helped reduce customer service contacts, freeing up customer service agents time to focus on other issues and delivering a better customer experience, and providing a much quicker and simpler way for users to report their damage.</p>
        <p>To arrive at this solution I first conducted exploratory research. As this was a time-sensitive project, we weren’t able to speak with any actual customers at this stage. I therefore spoke to customer service agents to gain a deep understanding into why customers contact them about damage and the pain points of these interactions. I also brought together research Onto already had, including user surveys and TrustPilot reviews to gain further understanding.</p>
        <p>I ran ideation workshops, tested wireframes and made iterations and created the initial damage reporting flow, which I then tested with real users. This gave a lot of valuable insight and we made a couple tweaks to the flow, before handing over to the engineering team.</p>

        <H6>DESIGN SYSTEM</H6>
        <p>As a Product Designer at Onto, a large part of my role has been updating, maintaining and following the design system. As a young company that has recently been through a rebrand process, the design system has been a work in a progress. Since joining Onto, I have ensured that 100% of the app’s design components follow the design design system.</p>
        <h4>Buttons</h4>
        <p>When I joined Onto I realised that there were a lot of inconsistencies in the way we used our buttons, especially between web and app. We also didn’t have all the states needed to be truly accessible in our design system, including a hover state. Our secondary buttons were not accessible on our commonly used background colours, which was really limiting.</p>
        <p>I therefore took it upon myself to redesign our buttons, ensuring we had all the states needed and we had enough flexibility. I used documentation to ensure the design team are using the buttons consistently.</p>
