        <H6>THE TASK</H6>
        <p>Ripple Energy is a renewable energy start-up on a mission to make green energy ownership accessible and affordable. We are doing this by allowing UK consumers to buy part of a wind farm and benefit from the cheaper, greener electricity it produces. 

        <p>Having launched our first wind farm in 2020, we already had a website, however I was given the brief to improve the sign up flow to ensure it is as easy and accessible as possible to help us get closer to our core mission.</p>

        <H6>RESEARCH</H6>
        <p>We already had a lot of data on user behaviour on our website from Hot Jar and Google Analytics. We knew the sign up flow could be improved, however, this data didn't give us any insight into what exactly users found difficult and how we could improve it for them. To uncover this I undertook usability tests on our old sign up flow with 8 participants. This was mid lock-down, so all of this was done over Zoom which actually worked really well, and meant I could test on a wider range of people from all over the UK which really fit our user persona. The usability tests were incredibly insightful , we gained so much knowledge into how users interacted with our site. The image below shows all my findings written out on post it notes, which I then used to create an affinity diagram — as you can see there was a lot of insights!
        </p>
      
        <img src="./Resources/Trew Fields/Ripple affinity diagram.png">

        <p>Key takeaways:</p>
        <p>1. Users found the sign up flow pretty easy (although there was room for improvement), however users struggled to understand what exactly Ripple is and how it works.</p>
        <p>2. Users wanted an idea of the cost straight away, rather than waiting to get to the quote page.</p>
        <p>3. The text and videos was generally easy to understand, although not everyone was able to find all the useful information easily.</p>

        <H6>PLANNING</H6>
        <p>I presented these back to the whole team and then ran a workshop to get as many ideas as we could on how we could improve based on my findings. I tried to encourage the team to be as crazy as possible with their ideas and not just think about what is possible within current constraints. We then went and voted on the best ideas and had a discussion on how we could make them feasible for our product.
          Again this was during lockdown so all this was done using Miro, which is great for team brainstorming sessions.
          With all these ideas mapped out I went on to decide what content users need to access to understand Ripple Energy based on the research findings. Myself and our Product Manager used Google Analytics and Hot Jar data to look through our users behaviour when they use our site. This enabled us to map out where certain content should live based on user behaviour.</p>

        <p>I used Figma to mock up the first version of the new pages, so that I could test this with participants, to see if it had improved and met our goals.
          I made some iterations, below is one example.

        <img id="ripplepics" src="./Resources/Trew Fields/ripple changes.png">
        
        <p>I then presented the designs back to the team to get their feedback. There were some features that were important to discuss with the wider team to ensure it was possible. For example, I added a ‘request a call back’ button on the sign up flow, as we know users want to speak to a real person to ask questions. However, being a start-up with a small team we had to have a discussion on whether we had the resource to deal with this.
          The designs were handed over to the development team. As the whole Ripple team had be involved from the outset of the project, the developers knew exactly what to expect and this made the handover super simple and straightforward.
          Our sign up flow is not currently live as we don’t have a project open, however here are some of the key changes that were made.</p>

        <p>The whole team was extremely happy with the new design, in particular how much better it explains Ripple to potential customers.
Being a small start up means we can be very agile and we can learn and iterate quickly. We are continuously learning and making amendments, which we can pick up quickly. I regularly speak to our users using our web chat function, which gives me really valuable insight into how users interact with our site and what can be improved. This is the current design, however we are continuing to make improvements.
