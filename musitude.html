        <H6>THE TASK</H6>
        <p>Musitude is on a mission to bring the joy of playing music to non-musicians. It allows users to use the most widely known interface - the QWERTY keyboard - to create beautiful music.

        <p>Musitude engaged with us to optimize the app by:</p>
      
        <p>1. Ensuring users understood the purpose of the app</p>
      
        <p>2. Introducing gamification</p>
      
        <p>3. Increasing engagement</p>
      
        <p>4. Improving the visual appeal of the app</p>

        <H6>RESEARCH</H6>
        <p>This was a very unique project - creating what is effectively a digital musical instrument. The process involved a lot of usability testing on  the current app which allowed us to understand the users' difficulties with the app and how we can improve it. We also conducted an online survey and domain research to understand what people liked and disliked about game and skill-building apps. </p>

        <p>Below is a summary of our research findings:</p>
      
        <img src="./Resources/Musitude/Musitude research findings.png">

        <p>We created an affinity diagram with our research findings to draw out key themes, which we used to decide on which features we should prioritise. Below is the list of features we decided on.</p>

        <H6>PLANNING</H6>
        <p>Based on our research, we created three user personas to better understand our users. Our main user, which we decided to focus on, is ‘The Musician Wannabee’.</p>
      
        <img src="./Resources/Musitude/Musitude Persona.png">

        <p>Based on this user persona, we created a user journey map and then moved on to create a user flow and site map, which gave us a structure to the app in which to build our designs. </p>

        <H6>DESIGN</H6>
        <p>In order to create the best and most user-friendly screens, we conducted brainstorming sessions, where we set a time limit to come up with as many designs for each of the main screens as we could. We then collaborated on our designs and pulled out the best features from each.

          We mocked up digital wireframes and prototyped them. We used this prototype to conduct usability testing with our designs. Based on user feedback we simplified some of the aspects of the scoring and created a sleeker design which is more user-friendly.
          
          ​We then handed the wireframes over to the UI team who bought the app to life! Below you can see an example of the transition from first wireframes to high fidelity screens.</p>

        <p class="bold">The challenge</p>
        <p>The challenge with this project was that there is nothing else quite like it. Musitude is completely unique in that it isn’t designed to be like playing a virtual piano or guitar, but it’s own musical instrument. We therefore had to be pretty innovative, as well as ensure that users understood what Musitude was. We did this by using short tutorials and keeping the design simple.</p>
        <p>The client was also very cautious about gamifying the app too much, as he wanted Musitude to be seen as a serious musical instrument. On the other hand, we found in our research that we needed some form of gamification to keep users interested. We therefore had to balance the client’s needs with user’s needs. We managed to do this by talking the client through our research findings and explaining why we were making the decisions we did. We also used gamification but in a way that gave a sense of achievement rather than just playing a game.</p>
        <p class="bold">Lessons learnt</p>
        <p>I loved this project because it was so different and it forced us to be creative. It really taught me the advantage of brainstorming and how coming up with crazy ideas can be so valuable in coming to a final solution. I do think we bit off more than we could chew to begin with however. If I was to do this project again I would focus first on fewer features and ensure those were really well designed before moving on to some of the additional ‘nice to haves’.</p>
