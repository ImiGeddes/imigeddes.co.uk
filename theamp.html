          <H6>THE TASK</H6>
          <p>The Amp is a Vancouver based social enterprise co-working space established by Ecotrust Canada. The Amp approached us to create a responsive web design that:</p>
        
          <p>1. Represents The Amp and their three core values - communities, collaboration and mission-driven</p>
        
          <p>2. Attracts non-members from social and environmental organisations to join</p>
        
          <p>3. Encourages current members to maintain occupancy</p>

          <H6>THE WHY</H6>
          <p>The ‘why’ is a purpose statement for The Amp. It acts as a focus point for us to base all further design decisions on.</p>
  
          <p>Based on our research of The Amp, we created the following ‘why’:</p>
  
          <p id="why">To inspire organisations to drive positive social change through collboration.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="planning">
          <H6>DESIGN DIRECTIONS</H6>
          <p>Based on our why statement, we created two design directions to present to the client. To do this, we made two different mood boards which represent different moods. These are shown below:</p>
        
          <img id="ampmood" src="./Resources/The Amp/moodboards.png">
  
          <p>Our client chose the inspiring direction (highlighted in the pink box).</p>
          <p>We used this mood board to decide on our visual language, shown below:</p>
        
          <div class="design-language">

        <div class="design">
          <H6>DESIGN</H6>
          <p>We used our design language to base all our key decisions for fonts, icons, illustrations, the colour palette, buttons and the logo. Below is the style tile, which shows these key decisions.</p> 
          <img id="ampstyletile" src="./Resources/The Amp/The Amp Style Tile 1.png">
          <p>We chose colours and fonts that are sophisticated enough for the business world, yet were still fun and inspiring, with a subtle nod to the environment through the use of greens and blues. We created flat illustrations and quirky offset-fill icons which give a modern and welcoming feel. We also updated the logo - keeping the basic shape of The Amp’s orginal logo, but updating it to be sleeker and modern with one colour and rounded edges.</p>

        <div class="design">
          <H6>THE RESULT</H6>
          <p>The UX team handed over the wireframes after extensive research, planning and testing. We were able to transform the wireframes using the design decisions above. We conducted further user testing with the high fidelity screens, and made more iterations to our designs. You can see an example of the transformation below.</p>

          <H6>NEXT STEPS & HANDOFF</H6>
          <p>We presented the designs to our client, ensuring they understood the reasoning behind our design decisions. Originally they were very reluctant to change the logo. Once they heard our rationale, and could see how the logo fit with the design, they loved it and said the whole design fit perfectly with their ethos.</p>
          <p>Next, it was to handoff to the developers. This was my first experience handing off my designs to developers, and therefore it was a bit bumpy to begin with. I learnt a lot, particularly how to structure my handoff files. In the end, we had a great relationship with the developers and communicated well, getting the job done.</p>

          <H6>REFLECTIONS</H6>
          <p class="bold">The challenge</p>
          <p>This project brought us two main challenges.</p>
          <p>The first - we had to ensure that the design depicted both the environment and the business world, with a splash of inspiration to ensure it kept with the mission of The Amp. At one point, our designs leaned too much toward the environmental theme and didn’t fit with a business co-working space. We rectified this by using straighter angles and more of the dark green colour. In the end I think our  colour palette, font choices and use of iconography and illustrations hit the mark.</p>
          <p>The second - The Amp did not have much budget, and therefore we did not have access to high quality photos. We knew we needed the website to show the office space, as this is one of the big selling points of The Amp. We therefore took matters into our own hands and took some pictures ourselves. These pictures worked great for the workspace pages, but were not high enough quality for the hero image or to create a really inspiring design. We therefore found a picture of the inconic building that The Amp is in to use as the hero image, and created illustrations which showed what The Amp is all about.</p>
          <p class="bold">Lessons learnt</p>
          <p>This project taught me to be adaptable - you may not have everything you want (in our case high quality photos), but that doesn’t mean you can’t create a good design. In our case, I think the fact we were slightly forced into using illustrations in lieu of photos created a more modern and fun design - which is exactly what we were going for. Additionally, as stated above, I learnt a lot about handoff and the importance of communicating well with developers.</p>
