          <H6>THE TASK</H6>
          <p>Seven Movements asked us to design an app that will host their seven minute movement videos and motivate users to move more.</p>
          
          <P>The Brief was to:</P>
          
          <p>1. Create an easy-to-navigate app that allows users to access Seven Movements’ exercise video tutorials, set personal goals and track their progress</p>
        
          <p>2. Create a brand identity — although Seven Movements already has a website, the client asked that we create a new style guide that is more representative of the brand</p>
        
          <p>3. Create an accessible app — Seven Movements has a high proportion of older users, so it was imperative that the design is accessible for the 55+ demographic and those with visual issues</p>

        <div class="research">
          <H6>THE WHY</H6>
          <p>After researching Seven Movements and speaking to the client we created a ‘why’ statement to act as a focus point to refer back to when making our design decisions. We decided the following ‘why’ statement really summed up what Seven Movements is all about:</p>
  
          <p id="sevenwhy">To provide everyone with the confidence and knowledge to develop healthy habits</p>
          <hr id="line"></hr>
        </div>

        <div class="planning">
          <H6>DESIGN DIRECTIONS</H6>
          <p>From our ‘why’ we created two design directions based on two different moods. We presented these to our client and they decided the “energy and confidence” mood fit best with Seven Movements.</p>
        
          <img id="ampmood" src="./Resources/Seven Movements/MOODBOARDS.png">
  
          <p>We then went on to make further design decisions on fonts, images and icons that fit with this mood and design language, and created the following style tile:</p>

        </div>

        <div class="design">
          <H6>ACCESSIBILITY</H6>
          <p>Accessibility was a very important part of this project. Our client had made clear that many Seven Movements users had visual impairements and were not digitally native. Our client himself was also colour blind, so at the forefront of our minds was ensuring our designs were accessible. We tested the colours out on people with colour blindness, including our client, and used online accessibility checker tools. Our colours scored very highly in these tests. We also used a larger font size of 20pt rather than the recommended 16pt, and chose the font Montserrat, which is a very easy to read and legible font. Finally, we used filled icons which are much easier to see than line icons, and ensured we included a written description of the icons underneath.</p>

        <div class="design">
          <H6>ICONOGRAPHY</H6>
          <p>Icons were a very important part of our design, as we used them to represent the exercises. These were a big part of the project and we created 75 icons in total. Below is an example of some of the icons.</p>

        <div class="design">
          <H6>THE RESULT</H6>
          <p>We put all the design elements together to create the high fidelity screens. We did a lot of testing and iterating to ensure the final result was user-friendly and was accessible.</p>
          <P>Below you can see some of the iterations we made to get to the final result.</P>

          <p class="bold">The challenge</p>
          <p>The biggest challenge for this project was ensuring our designs were accessible. We had to really empathise with the users while making design decisions, and not choose what looked the best to us but what would be most helpful to them. On many occassions we had to change parts of our designs to be more accessible. For example, our original colour palette didn’t score highly enough on online accessibility tests, so we tweaked that. Using a larger font size also made the layout more challenging, but was essential in providing a better experience for the users. </p>
          <p>The icons were also a big challenge for this project - not only did we have to create difficult shapes (eg. for hip pain or paddle boarding), we had to create a lot of icons. This was very time consuming, especially as we only had 3 weeks to complete the project. By dividing the icons up and ensuring uniformity by using the same grid to create the icons we got there after a lot of work.</p>
          <p class="bold">Lessons learnt</p>
          <p>I learnt a lot about accessibility while doing this project - often the colours I assumed would be perfectly accessible were difficult for those with colour blindness to see. Using online tools is a great help with this.</p>  
          <p>I also learnt a lot about time management - we could of spent the full three weeks just creating the icons, tweaking each of them to perfect them. In the end we decided done was better than perfect.</p>
