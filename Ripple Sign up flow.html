        <H6>THE TASK</H6>
        <p>Ripple Energy is a renewable energy start-up on a mission to make green energy ownership accessible and affordable. We are doing this by allowing UK consumers to buy part of a wind farm and benefit from the cheaper, greener electricity it produces. 

        <p>Having launched our first wind farm in 2020, we already had a website launched. However I was given the brief to improve the sign up flow. The previous sign up flow had a conversion rate of xx, and we decided we wanted to improve this to ensure that the sign up flow is as easy and accessible as possible - in line with our mission to make clean ownership as easy and affordable as possible.</p>

        <H6>RESEARCH</H6>
        <p>We already had a lot of data on user behaviour on our website from Hot Jar and Google Analytics. We knew the sign up flow could be improved, however, this data didn't give us any insight into what exactly users found difficult and how we could improve it for them. To uncover this I undertook usability tests on our old sign up flow with 8 participants. This was mid lock-down, so all of this was done over Zoom which actually worked really well, and meant I could test on a wider range of people from all over the UK which really fit our user persona. The usability tests were incredibly insightful….

        <p>Here is a summary of my research findings:</p>
      
        <img src="./Resources/Musitude/Musitude research findings.png">

        <p>We created an affinity diagram with our research findings to draw out key themes, which we used to decide on which features we should prioritise. Below is the list of features we decided on.</p>

        <p>Myself and the product manager used Google analytics and Hot Jar data to look through our users behaviour when they use our site. This enabled us to map out where certain content should live, and give them the best user journey.</p>

        <p>I then mocked up the first version of the new pages, so that I could test this with participants, to see if it had improved and met our goals.

          What changes?

          The designs were changed and handed over to the development team. As the whole Ripple team had be involved from the outset of the project, the developers knew exactly what to expect and this made the handover super simple and straightforward.
          
          Our sign up flow is not currently live as we don't have a project open,

        <H6>REFLECTIONS</H6>
        <p class="bold">The challenge</p>
        <p>The challenge with this project was that there is nothing else quite like it. Musitude is completely unique in that it isn’t designed to be like playing a virtual piano or guitar, but it’s own musical instrument. We therefore had to be pretty innovative, as well as ensure that users understood what Musitude was. We did this by using short tutorials and keeping the design simple.</p>
        <p>The client was also very cautious about gamifying the app too much, as he wanted Musitude to be seen as a serious musical instrument. On the other hand, we found in our research that we needed some form of gamification to keep users interested. We therefore had to balance the client’s needs with user’s needs. We managed to do this by talking the client through our research findings and explaining why we were making the decisions we did. We also used gamification but in a way that gave a sense of achievement rather than just playing a game.</p>
        <p class="bold">Lessons learnt</p>
        <p>I loved this project because it was so different and it forced us to be creative. It really taught me the advantage of brainstorming and how coming up with crazy ideas can be so valuable in coming to a final solution. I do think we bit off more than we could chew to begin with however. If I was to do this project again I would focus first on fewer features and ensure those were really well designed before moving on to some of the additional ‘nice to haves’.</p>
