          <H6>THE TASK</H6>
          <p>Ocean’s Edge approached me to create a website for a new luxury retreat they were opening in Newfoundland. The website was principally to be used as a marketing tool to attract potential customers, and to encourage users to contact the client to get a quote. They had a logo already, however the rest of the design decisions were up to me. </p>

        <div class="image-container">

        </div>

        <div class="research">
          <H6>RESEARCH</H6>
          <p>I kicked off the project by doing a lot of domain research to be inspired by other websites for luxurious accomodation. I compiled a selection of websites and conducted a gut test with my client, which gave me an understanding what they wanted from the project. I find gut tests to be really useful, as clients are often better at expressing their opinions when they can see something visual.</p>
  
          <p>I then sent out an online survey. The purpose of this was to understand what was important to users when deciding to book a holiday. I found that the 3 most important features users wanted to see when looking at accomodation websites were:</p>
  
          <p>1.   List of ammenities</p>
          <p>2.   Pictures of the facilities</p>
          <p>3.   Customer reviews</p>
          <hr id="line"></hr>
        </div>

        <div class="research">
          <H6>THE WHY</H6>
          <p>From my user research and looking into Newfoundland and the tourism industry, as well as speaking to the client I devised a ‘why’ statement that encompassed Ocean’s Edge:</p>
  
          <p id="oceansedgewhy">To allow travellers to explore the wilderness while living in luxury</p>
          <hr id="line"></hr>
        </div>

        <div class="planning">
          <H6>DESIGN DIRECTIONS</H6>
          <p>I used my ‘why’ statement to act as a base for two different design directions. For each, I started by creating a mood for each direction with different mood words, and then different design language. 
            I used this to make key design decisions on colours, fonts and iconography.
            Below you can see both directions shown by the mood boards and style tiles.</p>

          <img id="oceansedgeplanning" src="./Resources/Oceans Edge/STYLE TILES.png">
  
          <p>I presented both directions to the client, and they chose the ‘outdoor elegance’ direction, however they wanted to use some of the lighter beige colours from the rustic charm colour palette.</p>
        
          <hr id="line"></hr>
        </div>

        <div class="design">
          <H6>PLANNING</H6>
          <p>With the design direction finalised, I went on to planning the structure of the site. I ensured I kept the key users in mind throughout the process; they are affluent, older middle-aged, adventurous nature-lovers. The user is not a technology native, or someone that spends a lot of time online. The site must therefore be simple and straight-forward. However, as Ocean’s Edge is a luxury retreat, the website must provide enough information to show users that a trip there will be worth the money.</p> 
          <P>I kept the site map very simple, with a home page, three pages to show off the key things that Ocean’s Edge has to offer and the contact page.</P>
          <img id="oceansedgesitemap" src="./Resources/Oceans Edge/SITE MAP.png">

        </div>

        <div class="design">
          <H6>DESIGN</H6>
          <p>With the site map planned out I created wireframes for the site and drafted the copy. I did some user testing with the wireframes to ensure the site gave enough information to entice users in, without being overwhelmed. From testing, I realised that I needed to make the contact page more obvious and easy to access, as this is the end-goal that we wanted all users to get to.</p> 

          <p>I sent the wireframes to the client so they could read over the copy and suggest changes, without being distracted by the visual elements. I made iterations to the layout and the copy from feedback I received, then added the UI elements and photos. I was lucky that Ocean’s Edge had a whole library of great pictures to choose from, which I ensured were the focal point of the website, as they showed off how beautiful Ocean’s Edge is and allows the user to imagine themselves there.</p>

          <H6>REFLECTIONS</H6>
          <p>This was my first solo client project, where I was responsible for the full UX and UI. I found this to be a daunting challenge at first - I am normally a very collaborative designer, and I love brainstorming in groups to find creative solutions. Without other designers to bounce ideas off of, I found that user testing was even more important as I was able to get lots of ideas while talking to users.</p>
          <p>The second challenge was that the key users for Ocean’s Edge are not generally technically savvy. I had to really empathise with the user and ensure that what I was designing met their needs.</p>
          <p id="oceansedgebottom">This project taught me to be confident with my designs - when working alone you need to back yourself and your design decisions. I found that constantly reminding myself of the end user and the ‘why’ statement when making decisions allowed me to be confident in what I was doing.</p>
