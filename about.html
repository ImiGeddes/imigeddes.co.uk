        <div class="childhood-text">
          <p>I grew up in Surrey (although I like to say “basically London”). At school I developed a fascination for two things; the environment and design.</p>

          <div class="university-text">
            <p>I went to The University of Leeds and studied Sustainabiliy and Environmental Management, which I loved! I concentrated on behaviour change, which is where I developed my interest in creating solutions to help people and the environment.</div>

              <p>I became a Sustainability Consultant soon after I graduated. During my 2 years here I worked with many different people to understand their sustainability challenges and create solutions to solve them.
                Ultimately I decided that what I really wanted to do was design and research people’s behaviour.</p>

              <p>I decided before I left my consultancy job that I wanted to be a Product Designer, however I took the opportunity inbetween my career change to do something I always wanted to do: work abroad. So I booked a one way ticket to Buenos Aires and worked there as an English Teacher.</p>

              <p>Having done a tonne of research, reading and attending events I took the plunge and booked onto a UX & UI Design bootcamp at RED Academy. This was an incredible 6 months of intense work and learning, in both London and Vancouver.</p>
